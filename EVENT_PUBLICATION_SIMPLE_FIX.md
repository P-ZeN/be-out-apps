# Event Publication Flow - Simple Fix Summary

## The Issue
When organizers clicked "Publish" on approved events, the event showed as published in the organizer client but wasn't visible to the public.

## Root Cause
The organizer client was calling the wrong API endpoint:
- **Wrong**: `toggleEventPublication()` → sets `organizer_wants_published` field
- **Correct**: `publishEvent()` → sets `is_published` field

The frontend API correctly checks `is_published = true`, but the organizer actions weren't setting this field.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `/organizer-client/src/pages/Events.jsx`
```javascript
// BEFORE (wrong endpoint)
case "publish":
    response = await organizerService.toggleEventPublication(eventId, true);

// AFTER (correct endpoint)
case "publish":
    response = await organizerService.publishEvent(eventId, true);
```

### 2. `/organizer-client/src/components/EventFormWizard.jsx`
```javascript
// BEFORE (wrong endpoint)
await organizerService.toggleEventPublication(targetEventId, newWantsPublished);

// AFTER (correct endpoint)
await organizerService.publishEvent(targetEventId, newWantsPublished);
```

## Correct Flow (Now Working)
1. **Create Event**: `is_published = false`
2. **Submit for Review**: Still `is_published = false`
3. **Admin Approves**: Still `is_published = false` (waiting for organizer)
4. **Organizer Publishes**: `is_published = true` ✅ **Event becomes visible**
5. **Organizer Unpublishes**: `is_published = false` (event hidden again)

## API Endpoints Clarification
- `/api/organizer/events/:id/publish` → Sets `is_published` (main publication control)
- `/api/organizer/events/:id/toggle-publication` → Sets `organizer_wants_published` (helper field for dual-control systems)

The fix ensures organizers use the main publication control endpoint.
