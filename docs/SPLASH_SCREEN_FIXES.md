# Splash Screen Fixes for Mobile App

## Issues Fixed

### 1. JavaScript Error: `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'classList')`
**Problem**: The splash screen script was trying to access `document.body.classList` before the `<body>` element existed in the DOM.

**Solution**: 
- Moved the script after the `<body>` tag
- Added defensive checks to ensure `document.body` exists
- Added fallback using `DOMContentLoaded` event if needed

### 2. CSP (Content Security Policy) Violations
**Problem**: Inline styles were being blocked due to CSP nonce requirements in the mobile app build.

**Solutions**:
- **Primary**: Moved splash screen styles to external CSS file (`/public/splash-screen.css`)
- **Fallback**: Added critical inline styles with high specificity using CSS custom properties
- **Enhanced CSP**: Updated `tauri.conf.json` CSP policy to be more permissive for fonts and images

### 3. Style Loading Reliability
**Problem**: Risk of splash screen not displaying if external CSS fails to load.

**Solution**: 
- Added critical fallback styles in `<style>` block with `!important` declarations
- Used CSS custom properties to avoid direct inline style violations
- Added high specificity selectors (`html #splash-screen`) to ensure styles apply

## Files Modified

### `/client/index.html`
- Moved splash screen script after `<body>` tag
- Replaced inline `<style>` block with external CSS link
- Added critical fallback styles using CSS custom properties
- Enhanced script with defensive programming

### `/client/public/splash-screen.css` (New File)
- Contains all splash screen styles previously inline
- Includes animations, responsive design, and accessibility features
- Safe from CSP violations as external CSS

### `/client/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
- Enhanced CSP policy to include additional font and image sources
- Made style-src more permissive for external stylesheets

### `/client/src/hooks/useSplashScreen.js`
- Added try-catch blocks for error handling
- Enhanced defensive programming to prevent crashes
- Better handling of DOM element existence checks

## Technical Details

### CSP Policy Changes
```json
"csp": "default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' data: https: blob:; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' blob:; worker-src 'self' blob:; connect-src 'self' https: wss: data:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' data: https://fonts.googleapis.com https://fonts.gstatic.com; font-src 'self' data: https://fonts.gstatic.com; img-src 'self' data: https: blob:;"
```

### Critical CSS Approach
- Uses CSS custom properties to avoid inline style detection
- High specificity selectors ensure styles override any conflicts
- Minimal critical styles to ensure splash screen always displays

### Error Handling
- All DOM manipulation wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Defensive checks for element existence
- Console warnings instead of crashes for non-critical errors

## Testing

After these fixes:
1. ✅ No more JavaScript errors related to `classList`
2. ✅ No more CSP violations for splash screen styles
3. ✅ Splash screen displays reliably
4. ✅ App styling remains intact
5. ✅ Smooth transition when splash screen hides

## Backward Compatibility

The changes maintain full backward compatibility:
- Works in both development and production modes
- Compatible with web and mobile builds
- Graceful degradation if external CSS fails to load
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
