# URGENT: Deployment Status - Translation Files Not Updated

## Current Status: ‚ùå DEPLOYMENT NOT UPDATED

### Problem
- Deployed server still returns "Translation file not found" for footer namespace
- 404 errors persist in production despite Dockerfile fix
- Commits `b0202f6` and `8ce24ee` not reflected in deployed environment

### Evidence
```bash
curl "https://server.be-out-app.dedibox2.philippezenone.net/api/translations/fr/footer"
# Returns: {"error":"Translation file not found"}

curl "https://server.be-out-app.dedibox2.philippezenone.net/api/translations/fr/dashboard"
# Returns: 404 Not Found
```

But locally these work fine.

### Root Cause
**Dockploy deployment has NOT picked up the recent changes from staging branch.**

### Immediate Action Required
üö® **MANUAL DOCKPLOY INTERVENTION NEEDED** üö®

**Operator must:**
1. Access Dockploy dashboard
2. Navigate to Be-Out Apps server deployment
3. **Manually trigger rebuild/redeploy** from staging branch
4. Verify deployment picks up commit `b0202f6` which includes the Dockerfile fix

### Expected Result After Proper Deployment
‚úÖ `curl "https://server.be-out-app.dedibox2.philippezenone.net/api/translations/fr/footer"` should return footer translation data
‚úÖ All namespaces should be accessible: common, auth, home, navigation, onboarding, map, profile, bookings, payment, dashboard, footer, organizer
‚úÖ Client app language switching should work
‚úÖ Console errors should be resolved

### Current Working Local Configuration
- ‚úÖ Dockerfile fixed with `COPY translations ./translations`
- ‚úÖ Server code includes all necessary allowed namespaces
- ‚úÖ Translation files exist in `/server/translations/`
- ‚úÖ All changes committed to staging branch
