# Organizer-Specific Venue Management Implementation

## Summary

This implementation creates a comprehensive venue management system where each organizer can manage their own venues with standardized addresses, and the event creation form allows selecting from organizer's venues or creating new ones.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- **File**: `docs/migrations/010_create_organizer_venues.sql` (already applied)
- **File**: `docs/migrations/011_enforce_unique_venue_ownership.sql` (already applied)
- **File**: `docs/migrations/012_remove_legacy_venue_address_columns.sql` (already applied)
- **File**: `docs/migrations/013_add_venues_updated_at_column.sql` (run this now)
- Added `organizer_id` column to `venues` table (NOT NULL for unique ownership)
- Created function `get_organizer_venues()` to fetch organizer-specific venues with address information
- Migrated existing venues to use the new address system
- Removed legacy address columns from venues table (address, city, postal_code, country, latitude, longitude)
- Added `updated_at` column with automatic trigger to venues table
- Added proper indexing and constraints
- Enforces that each venue has a unique owner (organizer)

### 2. Backend API Updates
- **File**: `server/src/routes/organizer.js`
- Added complete venue management endpoints:
  - `GET /api/organizer/venues` - Get organizer's venues
  - `GET /api/organizer/venues/:id` - Get single venue
  - `POST /api/organizer/venues` - Create new venue
  - `PUT /api/organizer/venues/:id` - Update venue
  - `DELETE /api/organizer/venues/:id` - Delete venue
- All endpoints use the new address system from ADDRESS_STANDARDIZATION_PROPOSAL.md
- Proper validation and error handling

### 3. Frontend Service Updates
- **File**: `organizer-client/src/services/organizerService.js`
- Updated venue methods to use organizer-specific endpoints
- Added full CRUD operations for venue management

### 4. Venue Management UI

- Complete venue management interface with:
  - List of organizer's venues in a table

  - Proper validation and error handling
  - Uses the address standardization format

### 5. Navigation Updates

## Next Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration
Execute this SQL migration:
`docs/migrations/013_add_venues_updated_at_column.sql`

Note: Previous migrations have already been applied.

### 2. Test the Implementation
1. Start the backend server
2. Start the organizer client
3. Login as an organizer
4. Navigate to "Mes lieux" to test venue management
5. Create a new event and test the venue selection/creation

### 3. Optional Enhancements
- Add address geocoding API integration
- Add venue photo upload
- Add venue amenities/features
- Add venue availability calendar
- Add map integration for venue location

## Database Migration Required

You only need to run one more migration file:
`docs/migrations/013_add_venues_updated_at_column.sql`

**Migration 013** does:
- Adds missing `updated_at` column to venues table with automatic trigger
- Creates trigger function to automatically update timestamps on venue modifications
- Fixes the "column updated_at does not exist" error when updating venues

**Note**: All previous migrations (010, 011, 012) have already been applied.

## Benefits

1. **Unique Venue Ownership**: Each venue belongs to exactly one organizer, ensuring proper data isolation and security
2. **Organizer Isolation**: Each organizer can only see and manage their own venues
3. **Address Standardization**: Consistent address format across the application
4. **Better UX**: Streamlined venue creation directly from event form
5. **International Support**: Proper country codes and address formats
6. **Scalability**: Proper indexing and relationships for performance
7. **Data Integrity**: Proper validation and constraints
