# Mobile Safe Area Implementation - GitHub Issue Solution

This implementation is based on the proven solution from GitHub Issue [#11475](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/11475).

## Problem Solved

- **iOS**: AppBar was appearing behind the status bar/notch area
- **Android**: Content was overlapping with system UI elements

## Solution Implementation

### 1. HTML Meta Tag (Already Present)
- `viewport-fit=cover` in `index.html` enables safe area support
- This is **required** for CSS env() variables to work

### 2. Android Native Configuration
- Added `enableEdgeToEdge()` to `MainActivity.kt`
- This enables Android to respect safe area insets
- **Critical for Android** - CSS env() variables won't work without this

### 3. CSS Safe Area Handling
- Updated `App.css` with proven CSS approach
- Uses `max(env(safe-area-inset-bottom), 20px)` for better bottom padding
- Applied to `body.tauri-mobile` class

### 4. AppBar Positioning
- Updated `MainMenu.jsx` with direct CSS env() positioning
- Added side padding for landscape safe areas
- Positions AppBar below status bar/notch

## Key Insights from GitHub Issue

1. **iOS works with viewport-fit=cover + CSS env()** ✅
2. **Android requires enableEdgeToEdge() in MainActivity** ✅
3. **CSS env() variables only work after native Android setup** ✅
4. **Using max() function for bottom padding provides better fallback** ✅

## Testing

After implementing these changes:
1. Build mobile apps via CI/CD
2. Test on both iOS and Android devices
3. Check that AppBar appears below status bar
4. Verify content doesn't overlap system UI
