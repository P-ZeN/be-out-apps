# Translation Files Deployment Fix

## Problem
The deployed Dockploy apps were missing updated translation files, causing:
- 404 errors for footer translations
- Missing translation keys from recent internationalization work
- Language switching not working properly
- Old build timestamps indicating outdated deployments

## Root Cause
The server Dockerfile was creating empty translation directories but NOT copying the actual translation files from the local repository to the container.

## Solution Applied
Updated `/server/Dockerfile` to properly copy translation files:

```dockerfile
# Copy source code
COPY src ./src
COPY . .

# Copy updated translation files
COPY translations ./translations
```

## Files Updated
- **server/Dockerfile**: Added `COPY translations ./translations` command
- **Commit**: `b0202f6` - "Fix server Dockerfile to properly copy translation files for deployment"

## Expected Results After Redeployment
✅ Footer translations should load without 404 errors
✅ All recent translation modifications should be available
✅ Language switching should work properly
✅ Build timestamp should update to current date
✅ All namespaces (common, auth, home, navigation, onboarding, map, profile, bookings, footer, dashboard, payment, organizer) should be accessible

## Verification Steps
1. Check console for translation loading errors: `GET /api/translations/{lang}/{namespace}`
2. Test language switching functionality
3. Verify footer displays translated content
4. Check build timestamp in console logs

## Future Considerations
For ongoing translation management, consider implementing a hybrid approach:
- Volume mount for admin-edited translations
- Initialization script to update mounted volume with repository changes
- This would allow both deployment updates AND runtime admin modifications
