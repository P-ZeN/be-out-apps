# Google Auth Plugin iOS Build Fix

## Problem
The iOS build was failing with the error:
```
error: could not find native static library `tauri-plugin-google-auth`, perhaps an -L flag is missing?
```

This error was caused by the `links = "tauri-plugin-google-auth"` directive in the plugin's `Cargo.toml`, which tells Cargo to look for a native C library that doesn't exist.

## Root Cause
1. **Incorrect Cargo.toml Configuration**: The `links` directive is used for crates that provide native C libraries, but Tauri plugins don't need this.
2. **Missing iOS Implementation**: The iOS directory structure was missing from the repository.
3. **Incomplete Plugin Binding**: The iOS Swift code wasn't properly set up for Tauri plugin binding.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Cargo.toml
**File**: `/tauri-plugin-google-auth/Cargo.toml`
- **Removed**: `links = "tauri-plugin-google-auth"` line
- **Reason**: This directive is unnecessary for Tauri plugins and was causing the build failure

### 2. Created iOS Plugin Structure
**Files Created**:
- `/tauri-plugin-google-auth/ios/Package.swift` - Swift Package Manager configuration
- `/tauri-plugin-google-auth/ios/Sources/GoogleAuthPlugin.swift` - iOS implementation with placeholder
- `/tauri-plugin-google-auth/ios/README.md` - Documentation

### 3. iOS Implementation Details
The Swift implementation includes:
- **Placeholder Functions**: `ping()` and `googleSignIn()` methods
- **C-Compatible Bindings**: Required `@_cdecl` functions for Tauri integration
- **JSON Serialization**: Proper response formatting for Tauri
- **Error Handling**: Fallback responses for development

### 4. CI/CD Improvements
**File**: `.github/workflows/mobile-build.yml`
- Added verification step to check for the problematic `links` directive
- Enhanced error messages for plugin-specific issues
- Added iOS plugin structure validation

## Current Status
✅ **Build Error Fixed**: The "could not find native static library" error should be resolved
✅ **iOS Structure**: Complete iOS plugin structure is now in the repository
✅ **Placeholder Implementation**: Functional placeholder that allows iOS builds to complete
⚠️ **TODO**: Implement actual Google Sign-In functionality for iOS

## Next Steps for iOS Google Auth Implementation

1. **Add Google Sign-In SDK**:
   ```swift
   // In Package.swift dependencies:
   .package(url: "https://github.com/google/GoogleSignIn-iOS", from: "7.0.0")
   ```

2. **Update GoogleAuthPlugin.swift**:
   - Import GoogleSignIn framework
   - Implement actual OAuth2 flow
   - Handle authentication callbacks
   - Return real authentication tokens

3. **Configure iOS App**:
   - Add URL schemes to Info.plist
   - Configure OAuth2 client ID
   - Set up proper entitlements

4. **Test Integration**:
   - Test sign-in flow on iOS simulator
   - Verify token exchange with backend
   - Test error handling scenarios

## Important Notes
- ⚠️ **Do NOT re-add the `links` directive** to Cargo.toml
- The current implementation returns placeholder data for testing
- The iOS plugin structure must remain in the repository
- All functions are properly exported for Tauri binding

## Verification
To verify the fix is working:
1. Check that iOS builds complete without the native library error
2. Ensure the plugin loads in iOS (check console logs)
3. Test that placeholder functions return expected responses
4. Verify no Cargo linking errors in build logs
