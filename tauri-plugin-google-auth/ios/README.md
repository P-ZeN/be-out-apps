# iOS Google Auth Plugin

This directory contains the iOS-specific implementation for the Google Auth plugin.

## Current Status
- **Placeholder Implementation**: This is currently a minimal placeholder to prevent build failures.
- **TODO**: Implement actual Google Sign-In functionality for iOS using Google Sign-In SDK.

## Implementation Notes
- The Swift files in `Sources/` provide basic structure but need actual Google Sign-In integration
- Will need to add Google Sign-In SDK dependencies
- Needs proper iOS authentication flow implementation

## Usage
This plugin will be automatically included when building for iOS targets with Tauri.
