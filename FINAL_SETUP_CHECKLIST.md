# 🎯 File Storage Setup - Final Checklist

## ✅ What's Already Done:
- ✅ SQL migration ran (file storage tables created)
- ✅ File upload routes implemented in backend
- ✅ Static file serving already configured in Node.js
- ✅ Frontend upload components ready

## 🔧 What You Need to Do in Dockploy:

### 1. Add Environment Variables to Your Server App:
```env
UPLOAD_PATH=/app/uploads
PUBLIC_FILES_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com/uploads
MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760
ALLOWED_IMAGE_TYPES=image/jpeg,image/png,image/webp,image/gif
```

### 2. Add Volume Mount to Your Server App:
- **Container Path**: `/app/uploads`
- **Volume Name**: `beout_uploads`
- **Access Mode**: Read/Write

### 3. Redeploy Your Server App
- Click "Redeploy" in Dockploy
- Wait for deployment to complete

## 🎉 That's It!

### Your file URLs will be:
- **Upload endpoint**: `POST https://api.yourdomain.com/api/files/event-image`
- **File access**: `GET https://api.yourdomain.com/uploads/public/events/filename.jpg`

### Ready for:
- ✅ Organizer-client event image uploads
- ✅ Admin-client event image uploads
- ✅ Files persist across container rebuilds
- ✅ No nginx configuration needed
- ✅ No docker-compose.yml needed

## 🚨 Files NOT Needed:
- ❌ docker-compose.yml (Dockploy handles orchestration)
- ❌ nginx.conf (Node.js serves files directly)
- ❌ Custom nginx container

**Just add the environment variables and volume mount, then redeploy!** 🚀
