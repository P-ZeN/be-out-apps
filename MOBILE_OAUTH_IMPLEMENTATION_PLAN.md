# Mobile OAuth 2.0 Implementation Completion Plan

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ Working Components
- Web OAuth flow (fully functional)
- Android OAuth plugin infrastructure
- Server-side OAuth routes and authentication
- Basic iOS plugin structure

### ❌ Issues to Resolve

#### Android Issues
1. **Onboarding redirect failure** after successful Google login
2. **Onboarding data persistence** problems
3. Deep link handling may not be working correctly

#### iOS Issues
1. **Immediate crash** when clicking Google Sign-In button
2. ~~**CI build failures** due to Google Auth plugin~~ ✅ **RESOLVED** - iOS build now succeeds and .ipa installs properly
3. **No logging mechanism** for debugging crashes

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Android Issues

#### 1.1 Fix Onboarding Navigation
The issue appears to be in the authentication flow after successful Google login. The `AuthContext` should redirect to onboarding for users with `onboarding_complete: false`.

**Files to modify:**
- `client/src/context/AuthContext.jsx`
- `client/src/utils/auth/GoogleSignIn.js`
- `client/src/components/Login.jsx`

#### 1.2 Fix Onboarding Data Persistence
The onboarding completion process needs better error handling and validation.

**Files to modify:**
- `client/src/components/Onboarding.jsx`
- Server onboarding endpoints

### Phase 2: Complete iOS Implementation

#### 2.1 Fix iOS Plugin Implementation
Current iOS plugin needs proper Google Sign-In SDK integration and error handling.

**Files to modify:**
- `tauri-plugin-google-auth/ios/Sources/GoogleAuthPlugin.swift`
- `tauri-plugin-google-auth/ios/Package.swift`
- `client/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`

#### 2.2 Add iOS Debugging Support
Implement proper logging and crash reporting for iOS debugging.

~~#### 2.3 Fix CI Build Issues~~
~~Address iOS build failures in GitHub Actions.~~ ✅ **RESOLVED** - CI builds now work properly

### Phase 3: Testing and Integration

#### 3.1 Cross-Platform Testing
- Test both Android and iOS flows end-to-end
- Verify onboarding completion works correctly
- Test deep links and redirections

#### 3.2 Error Handling and User Experience
- Implement proper error messages
- Add loading states and feedback
- Handle edge cases (network issues, etc.)

## Implementation Details

### Android Fixes

#### Issue: Onboarding Navigation
The problem seems to be that after successful Google login, the navigation to onboarding doesn't fire properly. The issue is likely in the `AuthContext` or the way user data is passed after authentication.

#### Issue: Onboarding Data Persistence  
The onboarding form submission appears to fail, which could be due to:
- API endpoint issues
- Data validation problems
- Network connectivity issues
- Authentication token issues

### iOS Fixes

#### Issue: Immediate Crash
The crash when clicking the Google Sign-In button is likely due to:
- Missing Google Sign-In SDK configuration
- Incorrect iOS bundle setup
- Missing required permissions or info.plist entries
- Plugin initialization issues

#### Issue: CI Build Failures
~~The GitHub Actions iOS build fails because:~~
~~- Google Auth plugin compilation issues~~
~~- Missing iOS frameworks~~
~~- Incorrect Xcode project configuration~~
✅ **RESOLVED** - iOS builds now succeed and generate installable .ipa files

## Debugging Strategy

### For Android
1. Use Android logcat for real-time debugging
2. Implement console logging in JavaScript
3. Test with Chrome DevTools via `chrome://inspect`

### For iOS  
Since you only have a test iPhone and no Mac:
1. Implement remote logging to your server
2. Add JavaScript alerts for critical errors
3. Use Safari Web Inspector if possible
4. Implement a debug mode in the app that shows error details on screen

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Android fixes** - these are closer to working
2. **Implement iOS debugging infrastructure** before fixing iOS issues
3. **Fix iOS plugin step by step** with proper error handling
4. **Test end-to-end flows** on both platforms
5. **Update CI/CD** to handle both platforms correctly

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Android Google OAuth works end-to-end including onboarding
- [ ] iOS Google OAuth works without crashes
- [ ] Both platforms successfully complete onboarding flow
- [x] CI builds pass for both Android and iOS ✅ **RESOLVED**
- [ ] Proper error handling and user feedback on both platforms
- [ ] Deep links work correctly for mobile app redirections
