# How to serve uploaded files in Dockploy

## ðŸ¤” Where to Configure Nginx in Dockploy?

Dockploy handles nginx differently depending on your setup. Here are the options:

## Option 1: Dockploy's Built-in Reverse Proxy

If you're using Dockploy's built-in reverse proxy:

1. **Go to your app in Dockploy**
2. **Look for "Domains" or "Routing" section**
3. **Add a new route for static files:**
   - Path: `/uploads/*`
   - Target: File serving (if available)

## Option 2: Custom Nginx Container

If you need more control, add a separate nginx service:

1. **Create a new "Generic" app in Dockploy**
2. **Use this simple nginx setup:**

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

3. **Mount the same volume as your server**

## Option 3: Simple Solution - Serve Files from Node.js

**EASIEST APPROACH:** Let your Node.js server serve the files directly!

### Update your server code:

```javascript
// Add this to your server/src/index.js
import express from 'express';
import path from 'path';

const app = express();

// Serve static files from uploads directory
app.use('/uploads', express.static(path.join(process.cwd(), 'uploads'), {
    setHeaders: (res, path) => {
        // Add CORS headers
        res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
        res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET');

        // Cache images for 1 year
        if (path.match(/\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|webp|svg)$/)) {
            res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=31536000, immutable');
        }
    }
}));

// Your existing routes...
```

## Option 4: Check Dockploy Documentation

Different Dockploy versions have different nginx configuration methods:

1. **Look for "Proxy" or "Routing" in your app settings**
2. **Check if there's a "Custom nginx config" option**
3. **Look for "Static files" or "File serving" options**

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended: Use Node.js Static Serving

Since you already have a Node.js server, the simplest approach is to serve files directly from Node.js. This works with any Dockploy setup and requires no nginx configuration.
